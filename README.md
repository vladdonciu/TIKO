## 🌱 Development Workflow & Git Rules

To maintain stability and code quality, this project uses a feature-branch workflow.

- Do NOT commit directly to `main`
- All work must be done in feature branches
- All changes must go through Pull Requests (PR)
- PR review is required before merge
- `main` must always remain stable and deployable
